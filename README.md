# Deeplearning_miniproject

This zip file contains the submission files for the mini project in the course Deep Learning Fall Semester 2024. 

This project is made from 2 Python files: train.py and inference.py 

train.py is used to build and train the neural network model and inference.py is used to make classifications on images of cars. The .jpg-files is the folder are a few samples that can be used for testing the inference script. 

best_model.pth is the output of the train.py.script which saves the model with the best results. best_model.pth is then used by the inference script to make inference on new images.
